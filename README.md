# Train Schedule

This project can be used to find out a train's next arrival time and minutes until that arrival time. 

## Getting Started

Under "Add a Train," add a train's name, destination, first train time, and frequency of train. After clicking submit, you are alerted if the train is added successfully. Then, data about the newest train will appear as a new row in the Current Train Schedule table. Train Name, Destination, Frequency (min), Next Arrival, and	Minutes Away are included on the Current Train Schedule.
